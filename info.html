<h1>How The Book Shaped My Community</h1>
<p>
 The book showed how community could isolate or connect people. I chose a street side plaza, housing for the lower class, and a park with a riverwalk so that people are more drawn together and not divided as much by class.
</p>
<p>
It also had stuff about privilege and opportunity. . In contrast to the abysmal system controlled by Esteban T., the neighborhood mixes housing prices, it reserves some apartments to be income‑based, and paid internships through local businesses give students and families access to skills and jobs and give everyone opportunity.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the novel’s focus on writing inspired me to include a community library and writing center where people can gather, work, learn, and share stories.
